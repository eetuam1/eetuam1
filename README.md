## [Notes App](https://github.com/eetuam1/NotesAppPhone)
"A mobile application designed for Android devices that allows users to create, save, and delete notes easily. The app features a user-friendly interface, making note management simple and efficient."

### Programming Language and Environment
I built the Notes App using Java in the Android Studio environment. To keep notes safe even when the app is closed, I used SharedPreferences for data storage. Additionally, I incorporated AndroidX libraries, which provide essential features and functionalities for modern Android apps.
