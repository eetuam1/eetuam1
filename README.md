# ✌️ Hi, I'm Eetu!

## 🙇 About me 
Hey there! I'm someone who genuinely loves coding—feels more like a hobby than anything else. I’m always excited to dive into new languages, tools, or projects, and there's nothing better than figuring out a challenging problem or learning something unexpected along the way. Right now, I’m really into Java, JavaScript and Kotlin, but I’m always open to exploring wherever curiosity takes me.

##  💻  Currently working on
- A React-based website for the Puistolan Urheilijat men's football team
- A react-based social media platform for the animals called PetPals
- Improving my programming skills, focusing on Java, JavaScript, Python and Kotlin

##  📚  Languages and Tools
#### JavaScript, Java, Python, Kotlin, React, Docker, Git, HTML5, CSS3, Jenkins, StarUml, MySQL, HeidiSQL

# 📂 Projects

## 📋 [Notes App](https://github.com/eetuam1/NotesAppPhone)  
A mobile application designed for Android devices that allows users to create, save, and delete notes easily. The app features a user-friendly interface, making note management simple and efficient.

### Programming Language and Environment
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-007396?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white" />
I built the Notes App using Java in the Android Studio environment. To keep notes safe even when the app is closed, I used SharedPreferences for data storage. Additionally, I incorporated AndroidX libraries, which provide essential features and functionalities for modern Android apps.

## 🎮 [Medihelipeli](https://github.com/eetuam1/Medihelipeli/tree/main) 
Medihelipeli is a rescue game where the player’s goal is to save patients across Norway. Players must transport patients from their locations to the nearest hospital using a helicopter that can carry 1-3 patients at a time. The game requires strategic thinking to ensure all patients are rescued before running out of fuel.
