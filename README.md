# ✌️ Hi, I'm Eetu!

## 🙇 About me 
Hey there! I'm someone who genuinely loves coding feels more like a hobby than anything else. I’m always excited to dive into new languages, tools, or projects, and there's nothing better than figuring out a challenging problem or learning something unexpected along the way. Right now, I’m really into Java, JavaScript and Kotlin, but I’m always open to exploring wherever curiosity takes me.

##  💻  Currently working on
- A React-based website for the Puistolan Urheilijat men's football team
- A React-based social media platform for the animals called PetPals
- Improving my programming skills, focusing on Java, JavaScript, Python and Kotlin

I builted the Notes App using Java in the Android Studio environment. To keep notes safe even when the app is closed, I used SharedPreferences for data storage. Additionally, I incorporated AndroidX libraries, which provide essential features and functionalities for modern Android apps.

## 🏬 [StoreSimulator](https://github.com/eetuam1/StoreSimulator)
StoreSimulator is a simulation tool designed to model customer flows and manage queues across various service points, such as customer service counters and checkout lines. The goal of this project is to realistically simulate customer behavior, providing insights into optimizing service points and enhancing queue management. The simulator also features visualizations to help monitor customer experiences intuitively.
